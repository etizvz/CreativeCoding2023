     <p>
    In this assignment we were asked to create an optical illusion and we were invited to input our cultural experiences such as an environment you’ve grown up or media we were informed by and more. I have deep love for for Arabic lettering and typography and I was inspired by the islamic geometric art that is found in islamic and pattern designs, and I wanted to achieve that feeling within this piece of art. I created 3 versions of the same concept with different colors, for the black and white to achieve that classic illusion look that kind of gives the overwhelms when you see it. The 2nd version was random color with the movement and finally the last version was in the colors white and blue which mostly represent the islamic geometric art and architecture.

      <p>
       This project opened so many doors for me in terms of experimenting with text and movement; as a motion designer who worked a lot with animation and did not really do it in my master’s studies, my interest slightly shifted away from the tools I used for creating animation because I want to explore creating animation with code in the meantime. I finally got to a point where I can experience this with p5js. I plan to make a series of this art piece and implant words, phrases, and animation to master this project with beautiful art.
